Advent of Code 2020
=== 

I started with Python but might switch to C#. My goal is to spend 1 - 1.5 hours on the problem and then move on. In some cases a brute 
force answer is all I am really looking for. 

I'll try to sum up each day below. I am also not looking to use the more 'advanced' data structures within the language and instead would 
rather have a brute force solution.

## Day 1
My answer uses somethiwng like n^3. I think a better solution might be to get the complment and do some checking of the numbers that 
way we can skip going through the entire list multiple times as this would get slow. Another idea would be to sort the list throwing out 
numbers that are to large and to small. 

## Day 2
Created a class for the password and kept track of whether it was valid within the class. Could do a better job of sperating out parsing the input better

## Day 3
Was able to do the first part, second part I left incomplete. I think the "Right 1, down 2" needs to be checked but not sure.

## Day 4
Counted the ':' and just checked if the line had 'cid'. Could most likely use less looping by cleaing the input better. Did not feel like doing part II.

## Day 5 
Finsished on day after. Wanted to figure it out with a 'midpoint formula' solution but figured out the binary solution instead. Second part was just sorting 
and seeing the missing value? 

## Day 6 
Used to many loops. Knowing more Python would probably reduce the amount of loops and such.
