Advent of Code 2020
=== 

I started with Python but might switch to C#. My goal is to spend 1 - 1.5 hours on the problem and then move on. In some cases a brute 
force answer is all I am really looking for. 

I'll try to sum up each day below. I am also not looking to use the more 'advanced' data structures within the language and instead would 
rather have a brute force solution.

## Day 1
My answer uses somethiwng like n^3. I think a better solution might be to get the complment and do some checking of the numbers that 
way we can skip going through the entire list multiple times as this would get slow. Another idea would be to sort the list throwing out 
numbers that are to large and to small.
